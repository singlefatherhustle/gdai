# Metro 2 Dispute Tool

## Overview
The Metro 2 Dispute Tool is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the process of credit report parsing, Metro 2 compliant file generation, and the creation of Letters of Intent to Sue (LOITS). Optimized for small business use, this tool provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a web interface to handle large files, integrate AI-powered analysis via FinBERT, and produce dynamic, personalized dispute letters.

## Features
- **Credit Report Parsing**: 
  - Fetch reports via API or parse local files (XML, CSV, JSON)
  - Optimized for large files with streaming and chunked processing
  - Graceful handling of unsupported formats and robust error logging
- **Metro 2 File Generation**:
  - Generates fully compliant files with dynamic segment inclusion (Header, Base, J1, J2, K1, Trailer)
  - Memory-efficient processing and field validation
- **LOITS Generator**:
  - Creates personalized Letters of Intent to Sue using dynamic data and AI-powered sentiment analysis
  - Integrates with FinBERT to analyze dispute reasons and include evaluation labels
- **CLI & Web Interface**:
  - User-friendly CLI built with Typer for clear command structure and input validation
  - FastAPI-based web interface (with potential for secure authentication and asynchronous job status tracking)
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Asynchronous I/O and batch processing for large datasets
  - Model reuse for FinBERT to minimize initialization overhead

## Directory StructureHere are the optimizations needed for your project:

### 1. **Credit Report Parsing (**``**)**:

- **Issue**: The logic for handling XML, CSV, and JSON formats is basic.
- **Improvement**:
  - Add validation to handle unsupported formats gracefully.
  - Optimize parsing for large files using streaming libraries like `lxml` or chunked processing for CSV.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  def parse_large_csv(file_path):
      for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=10000):
          yield chunk
  ```

### 2. **Metro 2 Generator (**``**)**:

- **Issue**: The file generation is currently a placeholder.
- **Improvement**:
  - Implement precise Metro 2 field mappings.
  - Add support for dynamic segment inclusion (e.g., J1, J2, K1).
  - Optimize for large-scale file generation by writing directly to disk instead of holding everything in memory.

### 3. **Hugging Face Integration (**``**)**:

- **Issue**: Each call loads the FinBERT model, which is resource-intensive.
- **Improvement**:
  - Load the model once and reuse it for multiple predictions.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from transformers import pipeline

  finbert_pipeline = pipeline("text-classification", model="yiyanghkust/finbert-tone")

  def analyze_text(text):
      return finbert_pipeline(text)[0]
  ```

### 4. **LOITS Generator (**``**)**:

- **Issue**: The dispute reason is hardcoded.
- **Improvement**:
  - Make the dispute reason dynamic based on parsed credit report data.
  - Add more fields (e.g., consumer name, address) for better personalization.

### 5. **CLI and Web Interface (**``**, **``**)**:

- **Issue**: Lack of error handling and user-friendly prompts.
- **Improvement**:
  - Add validation for required arguments in CLI.
  - Improve error messages for user guidance.

### 6. **Performance Optimization**:

- Use multi-threading or asynchronous I/O for network calls (e.g., fetching credit reports from the API) to improve performance.
- If generating many Metro 2 files, implement batch processing to reduce memory overhead.

### 7. **Testing (**``**)**:

- **Issue**: Current tests don't cover edge cases.
- **Improvement**:
  - Add tests for large files, unsupported formats, and failed API calls.
  - Mock external APIs and Hugging Face models to speed up tests.

### 8. **Web Interface**:

- **Improvement**:
  - Add a secure login system for business users.
  - Include status tracking for uploaded reports and generated files.

### 9. **Documentation**:

- Expand README to include specific examples for LOITS generation and Metro 2 compliance.
- Include a "common errors and troubleshooting" section.

These optimizations will streamline your tool for small businesses and ensure it handles large-scale operations efficiently. Let me know if you need help implementing any of these changes!
